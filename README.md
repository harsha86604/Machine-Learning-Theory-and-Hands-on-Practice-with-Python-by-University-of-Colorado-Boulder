> In the Machine Learning specialization, we will cover Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and the basics of Deep Learning. You will apply ML algorithms to real-world data, learn when to use which model and why, and improve the performance of your models. Starting with supervised learning, we will cover linear and logistic regression, KNN, Decision trees, ensembling methods such as Random Forest and Boosting, and kernel methods such as SVM. Then we turn our attention to unsupervised methods, including dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA), clustering, and recommender systems. We finish with an introduction to deep learning basics, including choosing model architectures, building/training neural networks with libraries like Keras, and hands-on examples of CNNs and RNNs.

> This specialization can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulder’s Master of Science in Data Science (MS-DS) degree offered on the Coursera platform. The MS-DS is an interdisciplinary degree that brings together faculty from CU Boulder’s departments of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Information Science, and others. With performance-based admissions and no application process, the MS-DS is ideal for individuals with a broad range of undergraduate education and/or professional experience in computer science, information science, mathematics, and statistics. Learn more about the MS-DS program at [https://www.coursera.org/degrees/master-of-science-data-science-boulder](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/master-of-science-data-science-boulder).

> ## Applied Learning Project

> 

> In this specialization, you will build a movie recommendation system, identify cancer types based on RNA sequences, utilize CNNs for digital pathology, practice NLP techniques on disaster tweets, and even generate your images of dogs with GANs. You will complete a final supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning project to demonstrate course mastery.
